This is a regression analysis I did during a data analysis course. For this exercise, I was given a dataset, and the task was to analyse the relationship between healthcare costs (dependent variable) and specifically cigarette consumption and exercise. The regression analysis was done with R as well as numerous robustness checks. This project showcases my ability to individually compose data analysis within a given dataset.
