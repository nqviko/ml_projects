This is a school exercise where the coding was done on a template. The dataset generation, file list preparation and the outline and instructions for the model were given. The core contents of the model architecture and the training and validation loops were made by me. I feel this exercise showcases my ability to understand complex neural networks with multiple layers and the ability to execute a model given a specific outline.
